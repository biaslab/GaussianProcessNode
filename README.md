# Sparse Gaussian Process Node
This repository stores experiments for the paper "A factor graph approach to Variational Sparse Gaussian Processes". All codes are written in Julia programming language. 
Here is the guideline for running the experiments
- First, Julia needs to be set up. Use the following link to download the latest Julia version "https://julialang.org/downloads/" . If the latest version does not work, then download the version 1.11.0 "https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/" 
- Clone the repository to your machine.
- The experiments are presented by Jupyter notebooks and stored in the ***experiments*** folder. You can hit the button "run all", or press "Shift + Enter" to run individual cells.
